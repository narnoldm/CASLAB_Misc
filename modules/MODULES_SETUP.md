# MODULES SYSTEM 


It can be convienent to have modules setup on your development workstation especially if you use multiple different compilers or libraries. 

Modules is the same system that many clusters use. The open source website can be found [here](http://modules.sourceforge.net/). 



## Instalation
More detailed installation instructions can be found on the website. However for most CASLAB users Ubuntu is the default operating system. For this we can just use <code> apt-get </code>

```bash
    sudo apt-get install environment-modules
```
